# KDToolBox

KDAB's collection of miscellaneous useful C++ classes and stuff.

## Tools List

### Generic Tools

* [asan_assert_fail](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/general/asan_assert_fail)
  Intercept `cassert` failures with ASAN and print a backtrace.

### C++ Tools

* [future-backports](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/cpp/future-backports)
  Backports of future C++ library components to C++11:
  * k20::erase/k20::erase_if - C++20's uniform container erasure
* [DuplicateTracker](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/cpp/duplicatetracker)
  A helper class to keep track of "seen" elements, e.g. to avoid processing duplicate elements
  in a collection. It transparently uses `std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource` to improve
  its memory usage (compared to a 'plain' set implementation).
* [toContainer](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/cpp/toContainer)
  Helper functions to convert a container to another container, using a convenient pipeline style.
* [propagate_const](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/cpp/propagate_const)
  A backport of `propagate_const` from the C++ Extensions for Library Fundamentals version 3.

### Qt Tools

* [Ui Watchdog](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/ui_watchdog)
  A _header-only_ tool to break the program when the main-thread event loop is blocked for more
  than 300ms.
* [Qml Stacktrace Helper](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/qml/QmlStackTraceHelper)
  A function for retrieving a QML backtrace with gdb.
* [Qml PropertySelector](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/qml/PropertySelector)
  A QML Item to easily set property values based on a combination of conditions
* [Model/View ModelIterator](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/model_view/ModelIterator)
  A set of (template) classes to allow iteratating over QAbstractItemModels using std algorithms
* [Model/View SortProxyModel](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/model_view/sortProxyModel)
  A QSortFilterProxyModel replacement that just does sorting, but properly signals moves due to sorts.
* [Model/View UpdateableModel](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/model_view/updateableModel)
  A template class to make defining a model that sends proper update signals easy
* [Model/View Table to List Proxy](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/model_view/KDTableToListProxyModel)
  A proxy model flattening a table model into a list model (mainly for Qt Quick 2).
* [Functional Sort/Filter Proxy](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/model_view/KDFunctionalSortFilterProxyModel)
  A QSortFilterProxyModel convenience subclass that allows to set filtering/sorting functions,
  removing the need for subclassing.
* [TabWindow widget](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/tabWindow)
  A tab widget that allows extracting a tab to a new window, like modern web browsers.
* [EventFilter](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/eventfilter)
  A way for "connecting" a QEvent to lambda with two lines of code.
* [MessageHandler](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/messagehandler)
  An API to help you intercept the output going through qDebug()/qWarning()/etc.
* [QStringTokenizer](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/stringtokenizer)
  A universal, safe, zero-allocation string splitter.
* [Signal/Slot Connection Throttlers](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/KDSignalThrottler)
  An implementation of throttler/debouncer classes for signal/slot connections.
* [Single Shot Connect](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/singleshot_connect)
  A header only version of QObject::connect, that establishes a single shot connection.
* [Qt Hasher](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/qt_hasher)
  A header-only hasher object for using Qt types together with `unordered_map`, `unordered_set`, etc.
* [NotifyGuard](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/notify_guard)
  A RAII guard object to make sure object notification signals are properly emitted.
* [asan_assert_fail_qt](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/asan_assert_fail_qt)
  Intercept `Q_ASSERT` failures with ASAN and print a backtrace.
* [KDSqlDatabaseTransaction](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/KDSqlDatabaseTransaction)
  A RAII wrapper for database transactions when using the Qt SQL APIs.
* [pointer_cast](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/pointer_cast)
  Tools to ease migrating from `QSharedPointer` to `std::shared_ptr`.
* [qt_fmt](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/qt_fmt)
  Convenience for printing Qt classes through [libfmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt).
* [cmake-project](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/cmake-project)
  A replacement for `qmake -project`, generating a ready-to-use CMakeLists.txt.
* [includemocs](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/includemocs)
  A script to add inclusion of moc files to all .cpp files in the project.
* [KDStlContainerAdaptor](https://github.com/KDAB/KDToolBox/tree/master/qt/KDStlContainerAdaptor)
  Classes to ease the transition from Qt containers to the C++ Standard Library containers.

Qt6 Natvis file have moved to: [natvis4qt](https://github.com/narnaud/natvis4qt)
