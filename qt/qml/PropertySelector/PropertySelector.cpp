  @class PropertySelector
  @brief A QML Item to set one or more properties on a target based on a set of rules

  PropertySelector allows you to select which values to set on one or more properties based
  on a set of other boolean properties. This enables you to easily express complex 
  conditions, for instance to have the color of an item differ based on selection, hover, 
  checked and enabled status without complex binding expressions or imperative code.

  PropertySelector is a class that employs custom parsing of its contents, allowing it to
  use the QML syntax in a slightly different way. PropertySelector operates on a @ref target
  which by default is the parent item. That is the only convential property that it exposes.

  ##Rules, Conditions, Target Properties and Values##
  PropertySelector can be used by specifying Rules. A Rule is a construct that specifies 0 or
  more Conditions, a Target Property and a (Value) Binding for that property. Both Conditions
  and Target Properties are properties in the @ref target item. The Condition properties
  must be boolean properties that have a notify signal, while the Target Properties must be
  writable but may otherwise be of any type.

  To specify rules, PropertySelector employs the syntax for grouped properties. Each rule
  consists of zero or more Conditions that take the place of the (nested) property groups,
  with the Target Property taking the place of the (grouped) property. The Value Binding is
  the value that should be set if the rule matches the actual conditions on the target item.

  For example:
  \code{.qml}
  PropertySelector {
    checked.color: "red"
    hovered.color: _style.hoveredColor
    checked.hovered.color: _style.checkedHoveredColor
    color: "#dddddd"
  }
  \endcode

  The nested syntax for grouped properties is available too, so you can also use:
  \code{.qml}
  PropertySelector {
    checked {
      color: "red"
      hovered.color: _style.checkedHoveredColor
    }

    hovered.color: _style.hoveredColor
    color: "#dddddd"
  }
  \endcode

  ##Order of evaluation##
  In the examples above, we have four different Rules all specifying the same Target Property
  `color` for different Conditions. The rules to determine which Rule is used when are as
  follows: For any Target Property, the rule with the highest number of properties that are
  all fulfilled is applied. If there are more rules that have the same number of fulfilled
  properties, the rule specified last will be applied.

  In the example above, the rule without any conditions specifying a Value Binding `#dddddd`
  will only be applied if neither the `checked` nor the `hovered` conditions are fulfilled.
  If both are fulfilled, the Rule specifying both will be applied as this is the most
  specific rule that matches the Conditions. If only the `checked` Condition is fulfilled,
  the `red` Value Binding would be applied.

  ##Use cases##
  This Item may be used to simplify the specification of complex conditions for properties,
  which would otherwise require complex cascades of tenairy conditions in a binding or
  imperative code.

  ##Workings and limitations##
  This Item works by writing values the values from the Value Bindings to the Target
  Properties. Expressions for these values are supported, but currently don't result in
  actual property bindings. Instead, they are evaluated at the moment the assignment is
  made. Using objects or translations is currently *not* supported. Note that if no rule
  matches, the original value or property binding that was on the @ref target item's
  property is *not* restored. It is recommended to always have a condition-less Rule in
  place for each property as the default value.
